The attack of the city by dark forces and then the hero has to save the city and hopefully everything is fixed in the end.

What is it?
This is a game I made as my first project after joining the Web Development IRONHACK bootcamp.

What was the goal?
The goal was to make a top-down RPG game that would run and deploy in a browser. All made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

Why this one?
I would like to say it was after a lot of thinking but it would be a lie. I love RPG games, I love powers, it was pretty obvious for me.

Features
A charismatic taciturn hero !
Challenging difficulty
NPCs that guide you through your journey
Teerifying enemies

Issues
Collisions with building not on point
Damages done by enemies not always consistent
